#  Name:
#     smurf_extinction.def

#  Purpose:
#     Extinction correction parameters

#  Description
#     This file contains constants used for handling extinction
#     correction. The names in these values are not sub-instrument
#     names but are instead filter names. For SCUBA-2 it so happens that
#     the first filters to be used were named after the sub-instrument.

#  Notes:
#     This file is loaded by the map-maker defaults file. It is
#     separate to make it easier to be loaded into the EXTINCTION
#     task and in that it differs somewhat from other defaults
#     used by the map-maker.

#  Name: 	ext.taurelation.450
#  Type: 	(real,real,real)
#  Default: 	(26.0,-0.012,0.0)
#  Purpose: 	Controls the 450 um extinction values used in the EXT model
#               and the EXTINCTION task.
#  Description: Each tau relation is parameterised in the form:
#   		"tau_filt = a ( tau_cso + b + c sqrt(tau_cso) )",
#               where "a", "b" and "c" are the
#		three values supplied for this parameter. See also parameter
#               "ext.taurelation.850". Here, the trailing ".450" in the
#		parameter name is the filter name, not the sub-instrument
#		name as would be the case if it appeared at the start of
#		parameter name.
ext.taurelation.450 = (26.0,-0.012,0.0)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ext.taurelation.850
#  Type: 	(real,real,real)
#  Default:     (4.6,-0.0043,0.0)
#  Purpose: 	Controls the 850 um extinction values used in the EXT model
#               and the EXTINCTION task.
#  Description: The 850 um equivalent to the parameter "ext.taurelation.450".
ext.taurelation.850 =  (4.6,-0.0043,0.0)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ext.smoothwvm
#  Type: 	real
#  Default:     10.0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the extinction values used in the EXT model
#               and the EXTINCTION task.
#  Description: Indicates if we want WVM smoothing. The value is the
# 		size in seconds for the tophat function. A value of 0
#		disables smoothing.
ext.smoothwvm = 10.0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name:        ext.despikewvm
#  Type:        real
#  Default:     30.0
#  Purpose:     Controls the extinction values used in the EXT model
#               and the EXTINCTION task.
#  Description: Indicates if we want WVM despiking. The value is the
#               size in seconds for the despiking window. A value of 0
#               disables despiking.
ext.despikewvm = 30.0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name:        ext.despikewvmtol
#  Type:        real
#  Default:     0.10
#  Purpose:     Controls the extinction values used in the EXT model
#               and the EXTINCTION task.
#  Description: Indicates tolerance level for WVM despiking. The value is the
#               fractional spike threshold. A value of 0 disables despiking.
ext.despikewvmtol = 0.10

#  Default:     ${STARLINK_DIR}/share/smurf/csofit2.dat
#  Purpose: 	Path to file containing the CSO fit parameters
#  Description: Full path to file containing the CSO fit parameters.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name:	ext.wvmfit
#  Type:	string

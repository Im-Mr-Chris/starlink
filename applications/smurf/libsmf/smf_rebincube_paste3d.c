*  Name:
*     smf_rebincube_paste3d

*  Purpose:
*     Paste a single input spectrum into the output cube using nearest
*     neighbour rebinning and a 3D weights array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     int smf_rebincube_paste3d( dim_t nchan, dim_t nout, dim_t *spectab,
*                                dim_t iv0, dim_t nxy, double wgt,
*                                int genvar, double invar, float *ddata,
*                                float *data_array, float *var_array,
*                                double *wgt_array, int64_t *nused,
*                                int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     nchan = dim_t (Given)
*        Number of spectral channels in input cube.
*     nout = dim_t (Given)
*        Number of elements in output cube.
*     spectab = dim_t * (Given)
*        This array should have "nchan" elements, and each element should
*        hold the integer index (zero-based) of the nearest neighbouring
*        output channel. A value of -1 should flag input channels that do
*        not have any corresponding output channel.
*     iv0 = dim_t (Given)
*        The index within the output cube of the pixel corresponding to
*        channel zero of the output spectrum into which the input spectrum
*        is to be pasted.
*     nxy = dim_t (Given)
*        Number of elements in one spatial plane of the output cube.
*     wgt = double (Given)
*        The weight for the input spectrum.
*     genvar = int (Given)
*        Indicates how the output variances should be calculated:
*           0 = do not calculate any output variances
*           1 = use spread of input data values
*           2 = use system noise temperatures
*     invar = double (Given)
*        The Variance for the input spectrum.
*     ddata = float * (Given)
*        A pointer to the first data value in the input spectrum.
*     data_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        The 3D data array for the output cube. This is updated on exit to
*        include the data from the supplied input spectrum.
*     var_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        A 2D array in which to store the variances for the output cube if
*        "genvar" is not zero (the supplied pointer is ignored if "genvar" is
*        zero). The supplied array is updated on exit to include the data from
*        the supplied input spectrum. This array should be big enough to hold
*        a single spatial plane from the output cube (all planes in the
*        output cube will have the same variance).
*     wgt_array = double * (Given and Returned)
*        An array in which to store the relative weighting for each pixel in
*        the output cube. The supplied array is update on exit to include the
*        data from the supplied input spectrum. If "genvar" is 2, this array
*        should be big enough to hold a single spatial plane from the output
*        cube (all planes in the output cube will have the same weight). If
*        "genvar" is 2, this array should be big enough to hold two spatial
*        planes from the output cube.
*     nused = int64_t * (Given and Returned)
*        Use to accumulate the total number of input data samples that
*        have been pasted into the output cube.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the inherited status.

*  Returned Function Value:
*     A flag that is non-zero if and only if at least one good value from
*     the input spectrum was pasted into the output spectrum.

*  Description:
*     Paste a single input spectrum into the output cube using nearest
*     neighbour rebinning and a 2D weights array.

*  Name:
*     smf_qual_unmap

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap a quality array, copying values if appropriate

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_qual_t * smf_qual_unmap( ThrWorkForce *wf, int indf, smf_qfam_t family,
*                                  smf_qual_t * qual, smf_qual_t mask, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads
*     indf = int (Given)
*        NDF identifier
*     family = smf_qfam_t (Given)
*        Indicate which family of quality bits is represented in "qual".
*     qual = const smf_qual_t * (Given)
*        Pointer to quality data to be unmapped or freed. Should not be used
*        after calling this routine.
*     mask = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        A mask identifying the quality bits that are to be exported to
*        the NDF. All others are ignored.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     Returns a NULL pointer.

*  Description:
*     Unmaps quality values associated with an NDF. If the internal SMURF quality is
*     the same size as NDF quality (unsigned char) then this will simply
*     be a call to ndfUnmap. If the size differs and the NDF has been opened with
*     WRITE access the QUALITY component will be mapped and the values will be
*     copied after first compressing them to fit in 8 bytes.
*
*     Quality names are stored in the file corresponding to which bits were
*     present and which family was being used.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     - The pointer to quality must have been obtained by a call to
*     smf_qual_map.
*     - The quality names of the items written by this routine are recorded
*     using IRQ.
*     - We set badbits mask except when the MAP family is being used. This is
*     because currently MAKEMAP handles badbits mask based on config settings. The
*     fix here is to attach a badbits mask to the quality information.
*     - Attempts to free quality even if status is bad.

*  History:
*     2010-06-17 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*     2010-06-29 (TIMJ):
*        Always create new IRQ structure when writing out.
*     2010-07-06 (TIMJ):
*        Add SMF__Q_NOISE
*     2010-07-08 (TIMJ):
*        Enable quality in output file using ndfSbb.
*        Except for map family.
*     2010-10-04 (TIMJ):
*        If we do not know the family just copy the quality
*        to the output without using quality names and just
*        assuming a simple cast to unsigned char will be enough.
*     2011-04-15 (TIMJ):
*        Add SMF__Q_EXT
*     2011-04-26 (DSB):
*        Add SMF__Q_LOWAP
*     2011-05-26 (TIMJ):
*        Attempt to free QUAL memory even if status is bad.
*     2011-09-19 (DSB):
*        Add SMF__Q_BADEF
*     2014-1-13 (DSB):
*        Multi-threaded.
*     2014-2-28(DSB):
*        Add SMF__Q_RING
*     2016-11-09 (DSB):
*        Added argument mask.

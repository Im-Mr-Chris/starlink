*  Name:
*     smf_is_wvm_usable

*  Purpose:
*     Is the WVM thought to be usable for this data set?

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     isusable = smf_is_wvm_usable( const smfHead* hdr, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     hdr = const smfHead * (Given)
*        Header to examine to determine relevant information (date)
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Looks at the date in the header and compares that with a list of nights known
*     for an unstable or missing WVM. Assumes that unlisted nights are good.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     - Initially done with a static list of unstable nights hard-coded into source file.
*     - Nights supplied by Daniel Berke 2013-06-19

*  History:
*     2013-06-21 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*     {enter_further_changes_here}

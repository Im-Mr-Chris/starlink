*  Name:
*     smf_calc_fcon

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate a factor needed for converting input Tsys values into
*     Variance values.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     double smf_calc_fcon( smfData *data, dim_t nchan, int report,
*                           AstMapping **specmap, AstFrame **specframe,
*                           int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        Pointer to the input smfData structure.
*     nchan= int (Given)
*        The number of spectral channels in the input.
*     report = int (Given)
*        If non-zero, then report an error if the conversion factor
*        cannot be found.
*     specmap = AstMapping ** (Returned)
*        GRID->Spectral Mapping for current input file.
*     specframe = AstFrame ** (Returned)
*        SpecFrame describing input spectral axis.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the inherited status.

*  Description:
*     This function returns the ratio of the squared backend degradation
*     factor to the input spectral channel width, needed for calculating
*     the variances from the Tsys value. It is independent of the time slice.
*     The total factor for converting Tsys to Variance is the product of the
*     factor returned by this function, and the time-slice dependent factor
*     returned by smf_rebincube_tcon.

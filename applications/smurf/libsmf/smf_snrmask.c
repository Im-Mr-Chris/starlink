*  Name:
*     smf_snrmask

*  Purpose:
*     Return a 2D mask identifying the high SNR regions in a map.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_snrmask( ThrWorkForce *wf,  int abssnr, unsigned char *oldmask,
*                       const double *map, const double *mapvar,
*                       const dim_t *dims, double snr_hi, double snr_lo,
*                       unsigned char *mask, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads (can be NULL)
*     abssnr = int (Given)
*        Should be supplied non-zero if sources can be negative as well
*        as positive (e.g. when making maps of Q or U Stokes parameters).
*        If non-zero, large negative SNR values are treated as source rather
*        than background.
*     oldmask = unsigned char * (Given)
*        May be NULL. If supplied, any source pixels in the old mask (i.e.
*        zero values) are copied unchanged into the returned new mask. Only
*        background pixels in the old mask are allowed to be changed.
*        Thus source pixels are accumulated form itgeration to iteration.
*        In other words, "once a source pixel, always a source pixel".
*     map = const double * (Read)
*        The 2D map containing the data values, or SNR values if "mapvar"
*        is NULL.
*     mapvar = const double * (Read)
*        The 2D map containing the variance values. If this is NULL, then
*        the "map" array is assumed to contain SNR values rather than data
*        values.
*     dims = const dim_t * (Read)
*        The dimensions of the map.
*     snr_hi = double (Read)
*        The higher SNR value at which to do the initial cut.
*     snr_lo = double (Read)
*        The lower SNR value to which the mask defined by the initial cut
*        should be extended.
*     mask =  unsigned char * (Returned)
*        The array to recieve the mask - mask pixels are zero in the
*        "source" (i.e. high SNR) regions and non-zero in "background"
*        regions.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a mask based on SNR values that goes down
*     to low SNR values without including lots of isolated noise spikes.
*     It does this by forming an initial mask by thresholding the supplied
*     map at the high SNR value given by "snr_hi". Map pixels above this
*     threshold ("source" pixels) are set to one in the mask, and those
*     below the threshold ("Background" pixels) are set to zero. The
*     areas of source pixels within the mask are then extended down to
*     the lower SNR value given by "snr_lo". Finally, edges of the source
*     regions are smoothed using a cellular automaton that replaces the
*     central pixel in each 3x3 box of mask pixels by the most commonly
*     occuring value in the box (with a slight bias towards extending the
*     masked area). This smoothing is done three times.

*  History:
*     29-MAR-2012 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     14-MAR-2013 (DSB):
*        - Fix bug in checks for neighbours being off the edge of the map.
*        - When flagging adjoining clumps as source clumps, work down the
*        tree of neighbouring clumps as well as up the tree.
*        - Reduce the number of cleanings from 3 to 2.
*     15-MAR-2013 (DSB):
*        - Prevent segfault caused by erroneously using the
*        uninitialised first value of the "table" arrays.

*     10-MAR-2014 (DSB):
*        Added argument oldmask.
*     2-APR-2014 (DSB):
*        Allow SNR values to be supplied, rather than separate data and
*        variance values.

*        Added argument abssnr.

*     Perform various parallel operations for snf_snrmask.

*  Invocation:
*     void smf1_snrmask_job( void *job_data, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     job_data = void * (Given)
*        Pointer to the data needed by the job. Should be a pointer to a
*        smfSnrMaskJobData structure.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

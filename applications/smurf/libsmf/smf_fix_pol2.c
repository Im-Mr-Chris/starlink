*  Name:
*     smf_fix_pol2

*  Purpose:
*     Correct data for the POL-2 triggering issue.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_fix_pol2( smfArray *array, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     array = smfArray * (Given and Returned)
*        The data that will be fixed.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     According to Ryan Berthold, early data from POL-2 suffered from a
*     problem that caused it to "trigger on nothing". This causes an
*     extra spurious value to be inserted into the POL_ANG array in the
*     JCMTSTATE extension, causing later valid values to appear to be
*     delayed.

*  Authors:
*     David Berry (JAC)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     4-SEP_2012 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     7-SEP-2012 (DSB):
*        Complete re-write.
*     11-SEP-2012 (DSB):
*        Put VAL__BADD padding at the end of the POL_ANG array rather
*        than immediately before the last bonus point.
*     21-SEP-2012 (DSB):
*        Recent data contains POL_ANG values in radians rather than
*        arbitrary encoder units.
*     11-SEP-2015 (DSB):
*        Re-written because the old algorithm found 100 bonus points in
*        20150716/00021 when in fact there were none.
*     3-FEB-2016 (DSB):
*        Report error if HWP is not rotating.
*     13-SEP-2016 (DSB):
*        If unexpected featurs are found, issue a warning rather than
*        reporting an error. Also set POLANG values bad that occur after the
*        unexpected feature, so that the data prior to the unexpected
*        feature can be used.

*     curlag = int * (Given)
*        The lag at which to start searching. A range of lags between

*        An array holding the changes in POL_ANG value between adjacent

*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:

*     reliably.

*  Description:
*     This function shifts the "agaps" array backwards and forwards,
*     looking for the shift (lag) that gives the best correlation between
*     the agaps values and the tgaps values within a small box centred on
*     a specified index. This shift is returned.

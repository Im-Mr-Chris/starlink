*  Name:
*     smf_history_write

*  Purpose:
*     Write SMURF processing history to file

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_history_write( const smfData * data, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     data = const smfData* (Given)
*        Data struct to obtain file identifier from and history keymap
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status. Will be bad on return if this smfData
*        is not associated with a file.

*  Description:
*     This function synchronizes the history information stored in
*     the smfData with the file on disk. Does nothing if the smfData
*     is not open for write access. Does not affect the main NDF
*     HISTORY record.
*
*     It should be used primarily to tag activities that have been
*     performed on the data which can not be derived from the application
*     name. For example, since extinction correction may be performed
*     by both EXTINCTION and MAKEMAP it is important that a flag
*     can be written to the file to indicate that the data have been
*     extinction corrected.

*  History:
*     2006-01-24 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version.
*     2006-05-05 (AGG):
*        Add called to ndfHend to allow multiple distinct history writes
*     2006-07-05 (AGG):
*        Check for presence of history component before attempting to
*        write
*     2008-07-08 (TIMJ):
*        Need to copy input text to internal buffer to avoid const warning
*        from NDF API.
*     2009-09-17 (TIMJ):
*        No longer use NDF HISTORY.

*  Notes:
*     - SMURF subroutines should choose history "application" names
*       that are distinct from actual application names but describe
*       functionality. eg SMF_EXTINCTION, SMF_FLATFIELD rather than
*       "EXTINCTION" and "FLATFIELD".
*     - See also smf_history_check
*     - An error will occur if the file is opened read-only.
*     - It is an error to associate HISTORY with raw data files.
*     - The file is updated immediately.

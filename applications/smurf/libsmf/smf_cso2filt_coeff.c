*  Name:
*     smf_cso2filt_coeff

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain coefficients required to convert CSO scale tau to filter tau

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_cso2filt_coeff( const smfHead *hdr, AstKeyMap *extpars,
*                         size_t nvals, double coeffs[3], size_t *ncoeff, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     hdr = const smfHead* (Given)
*        Header struct from data struct
*     extpars = AstKeyMap * (Given)
*        AST keymap containing the parameters required to convert
*        the tau (on the CSO scale) to the current filter. Must
*        contain the "taurelation" key which itself will be a keymap
*        containing the parameters for the specific filter.
*     nvals = size_t (Given)
*        Number of elements in coeff[] array.
*     coeff = double [3] (Given & Returned)
*        Array to receive coefficients. Should be sized to at least 3 elements.
*     ncoeff = size_t * (Returned)
*        Number of coefficients stored in coeff[] array.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the coefficients required to convert a tau in
*     CSO scale to the relevant filter scale. Should be used in conjunction
*     with smf_cso2filt_applycoeff if the correction is to be applied in a loop.

*  Notes:
*     - The tau relation is formulated as:
*          tau_filt = a ( tau_cso + b + c sqrt(tau_cso) )
*       and the keymap should contain an entry named "taurelation_FILT"
*       containing "a", "b" and "c".
*     - The routine will not attempt to guess a tau relation.
*     - Use smf_cso2filt_applycoeff to apply the coefficients.
*     - Use smf_cso2filt_tau to retrieve coefficients and apply them in
*       a single call.

*  History:
*     2013-05-12 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version derived from smf_cso2filt_tau
*     2021-02-04 (GSB)
*        Increase number of coefficients to 3 and default any unspecified.

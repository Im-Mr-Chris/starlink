*  Name:
*     smf_deskpike_wvm

*  Purpose:
*     Given an array of WVM-derived opacities, attempt to remove spikes.

*  Language:
*     C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_despike_wvm(double* data, dim_t n, int width, double tol, int* status);

*  Arguments:
*     data = double* (Given)
*        Pointer to data array (which is to be modified).
*     n = dim_t (Given)
*        Length of data array.
*     width = int (Given)
*        Width of despiking box.
*     tol = double (Given)
*        Fractional tolerance.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Attempts to remove spikes from an array of WVM-derived opacities.  These
*     are identified as those points more than a fractional tolerance, "tol",
*     away from the median of a moving box of points of width "width".
*
*     Points determined to comprise spikes are replaced with the bad value.

*  Authors:
*     GSB: Graham Bell (EAO)
*     DSB: David S Berry (EAO)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     30-JAN-2016 (GSB):
*        Original version.
*     8-DEC-2016 (DSB):
*        - Add Authors and History sections to prologue.
*        - Check data is not bad before comparing it to the median. This
*        should not alter the results of this routine, but helps to avoid
*        unneccesary floating point exceptions when using feenableexcept to
*        track down other NaNs.

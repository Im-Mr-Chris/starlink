*  Name:
*     smf_chunkfactor

*  Purpose:
*     Get the calibration correction factor to use for a specified chunk.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     result = smf_chunkfactor( smfData *data, AstKeyMap *keymap,
*                               dim_t contchunk, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        The smfData holding the current chunk.
*     keymap = AstKeyMap * (Given)
*        The KeyMap holding the configuration parameters.
*     contchunk = dim_t (Given)
*        The zero-based index of the current chunk.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     The calibration correction factor, or 1.0 if an error occurs.

*  Description:
*     Return the calibration correction factor to use for the current
*     chunk of SCUBA-2 time series data. This is a factor that ensures
*     that the map made from the current chunk is calibrated in the same
*     way as maps made from other chunks. The factor is determined from
*     the CHUNKFACTOR value in the supplied KeyMap. If this is a vector
*     of doubles, then the value of the element with index "contchunk"
*     is returned. If the vector does not contain enough elements, then
*     the value of the last element is returned. If the CHUNKFACTOR
*     parameter is a text string, then it is assumed to be the name of
*     a FITS keyword that has a numerical value within the header of
*     the supplied smfData. An error is reported if neither of these
*     cases applies.

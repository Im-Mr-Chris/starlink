*  Name:
*     smf_cso2filt_applycoeff

*  Purpose:
*     Convert tau to filter scale using suppled coefficients

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     double smf_cso2filt_applycoeff( double csotau, const double coeffs[3],
*                                     int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     csotau = double (Given)
*        225GHz tau value. Returns VAL__BADD if it is bad. Returns zero if it
*        is zero.
*     coeffs = double[3] (Given)
*        Conversion Coefficients obtained by calling smf_cso2filt_coeff().
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine returns the optical depth for the given SCUBA-2
*     filter based on the supplied CSO tau value, using the supplied
*     conversion coefficients.

*  Notes:
*     - Returns a value of VAL__BADD if status is set bad on entry
*     - The tau relation is formulated as:
*          tau_filt = a ( tau_cso + b + c sqrt(tau_cso) )
*     - Since "b" is usually negative, the calculation is skipped if the
*       CSO tau is zero. The routine returns a tau of 0.0.
*     - Coefficients should be obtained by calling smf_cso2filt_coeff

*  History:
*     2013-05-12 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version, derived from smf_cso2filt_tau
*     2021-02-04 (GSB)
*        Add third coefficient for sqrt(tau_cso) term.

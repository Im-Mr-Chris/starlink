*  Name:
*     smf_flag_rings

*  Purpose:
*     Flag samples that show strong filter ringing.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     dim_t smf_flag_rings( double *data, dim_t stride, dim_t nel, dim_t box1,
*                           dim_t box2, double nsigma, dim_t wing, dim_t minsize,
*                           smf_qual_t *qual, smf_qual_t qmask,
*                           const unsigned char *mask, const int *lut,
*                           int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     data = double * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the 1D array to be checked for ringing.
*     stride = (Given)
*        Stride between elements in the data array.
*     nel = dim_t (Given)
*        Number of points in the input data.
*     box1 = dim_t (Given)
*        The size of the first filter (in array elements). This should
*        normally correspond to the FLT filter width.
*     box2 = dim_t (Given)
*        The size of the second filter (in array elements). This should
*        be several times the value of "box1".
*     nsigma = double (Given)
*        The number of standard deviations at which to flag samples.
*     wing = dim_t (Given)
*        The number of extra samples to flag on either side of a section
*        flagged as oscillatory.
*     minsize = dim_t (Given)
*        The minimum number of samples in a section of contiguous ringing
*        samples that will be flagged. Section shorter than this size
*        will never be flagged.
*     qual = smf_qual_t * (Given and Returned)
*        The QUALITY array associated with the data array. On entry, it
*        is assumed that no samples are flagged with SMF__Q_RING. On exit,
*        samples that are flagged as ringing samples by this function are
*        assigned the quality SMF__Q_RING
*     qmask = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        Use with qual to define which samples should be included in the
*        filtered values.
*     mask = const unsigned char * (Given)
*        NULL, or a pointer to a 2D mask which is zero in source regions,
*        and non-zero for background regions. The mask should have the same
*        pixel bounds as the output map. If supplied, samples that fall
*        within source regions are never flagged by this function (i.e.
*        only background pixels are flagged).
*     lut = const int * (Given)
*        Only used if "mask" is not NULL. It should be a pointer to the
*        look-up-tyable that gives the map pixel index for each sample index.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of samples to which the SMF__Q_RING quality were assigned.

*  Description:
*     This routine locates sections of the supplied data array that appear
*     to oscillate about zero with a period of "box1" or less, and
*     assigns the flag SM__Q_RING to them in the supplied quality array.

*     17-OCT-2013 (DSB):

*        - Add new arguments "mask" and "lut".

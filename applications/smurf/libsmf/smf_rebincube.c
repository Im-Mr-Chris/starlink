*  Name:
*     smf_rebincube

*  Purpose:
*     Paste a supplied 3D array into an existing output cube.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_rebincube( ThrWorkForce *wf, smfData *data, int first, int last,
*                    dim_t *ptime, int badmask, int is2d,
*                    AstSkyFrame *abskyfrm, AstMapping *oskymap,
*                    AstFrame *ospecfrm, AstMapping *ospecmap,
*                    Grp **detgrp, int moving, int usewgt, int spread,
*                    const double params[], dim_t lbnd_out[ 3 ],
*                    dim_t ubnd_out[ 3 ], int genvar, float *data_array,
*                    float *var_array, double *wgt_array, float *texp_array,
*                    float *teff_array, double *fcon, int64_t *nused,
*                    dim_t *nreject, int *naccept, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads that will do the re-binning.
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        Pointer to the input smfData structure.
*     first = int (Given)
*        Is this the first call to this routine for the current output
*        cube?
*     last = int (Given)
*        Is this the last call to this routine for the current output
*        cube?
*     ptime = dim_t * (Given)
*        Pointer to an array of integers, each one being the index of a
*        time slice that is to be pasted into the output cube. If this is
*        NULL, then all time slices are used. The values in the array
*        should be monotonic increasing and should be terminated by a value
*        of VAL__MAXK.
*     badmask = int (Given)
*        Indicates how the bad pixel mask for each output spectrum is
*        determined. A value of zero causes the bad pixel mask for each
*        output spectrum to be identical to the bad pixel mask of the
*        first input spectrum that contributes to the output spectrum.
*        Any subsequent input spectra that contribute to the same output
*        spectrum but have a different bad pixel mask are ignored. A
*        "badmask" value of 1 causes the bad pixel mask for each output
*        spectrum to be the union of the bad pixel masks of all input
*        spectra that contribute to the output spectrum. That is, an
*        output pixel will be bad if any of the input pixels that
*        contribute to it are bad.
*     is2d = int (Given)
*        Should a 2D weights array be used? If so, the weight and
*        variance within a single output spectrum is assumed to be the
*        same for all spectral channels, and so 2D instead of 3D arrays
*        can be used, saving lots of memory. A 2D array has a single
*        element for each spectrum in the output NDF. A 3D array has an
*        element for every element in the output NDF.
*     abskyfrm = AstSkyFrame * (Given)
*        A SkyFrame that specifies the coordinate system used to describe
*        the spatial axes of the output cube. This should represent
*        absolute sky coordinates rather than offsets even if "moving" is
*        non-zero.
*     oskymap = AstFrameSet * (Given)
*        A Mapping from 2D sky coordinates in the output cube to 2D
*        spatial grid coordinates in the output cube.
*     ospecfrm = AstFrame * (Given)
*        Pointer to the SpecFrame within the current Frame of the output WCS
*        Frameset.
*     ospecmap = AstMapping * (Given)
*        Pointer to the Mapping from the SpecFrame to the third GRID axis
*        within the current Frame of the output WCS Frameset.
*     detgrp = Grp ** (Given)
*        On entry, a Group containing the names of the detectors to be
*        used. All detectors will be used if this group is empty (or NULL).
*        On exit, the supplied group (if any) is deleted, and a new group
*        is created and return holding the names of the detectors that
*        contributed good data to the output cube.
*     moving = int (Given)
*        A flag indicating if the telescope is tracking a moving object. If
*        so, each time slice is shifted so that the position specified by
*        TCS_AZ_BC1/2 is mapped on to the same pixel position in the
*        output cube.
*     usewgt = int (Given)
*        A flag indicating if the input data should be weighted according
*        to the input variances determined from the input Tsys values.
*     spread = int (Given)
*        Specifies the scheme to be used for dividing each input data value
*        up amongst the corresponding output pixels. See docs for astRebinSeq
*        (SUN/211) for the allowed values.
*     params = const double[] (Given)
*        An optional pointer to an array of double which should contain any
*        additional parameter values required by the pixel spreading scheme.
*        See docs for astRebinSeq (SUN/211) for further information. If no
*        additional parameters are required, this array is not used and a
*        NULL pointer may be given.
*     lbnd_out = dim_t [ 3 ] (Given)
*        The lower pixel index bounds of the output cube.
*     ubnd_out = dim_t [ 3 ] (Given)
*        The upper pixel index bounds of the output cube.
*     genvar = int (Given)
*        Indicates how the output variances should be calculated:
*           0 = do not calculate any output variances
*           1 = use spread of input data values
*           2 = use system noise temperatures
*     data_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        The 3D data array for the output cube. This is updated on exit to
*        include the data from the supplied input NDF.
*     var_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        An array in which to store the variances for the output cube if
*        "genvar" is not zero (the supplied pointer is ignored if "genvar" is
*        zero). The supplied array is update on exit to include the data from
*        the supplied input NDF. If "is2d" is non-zero, then this array
*        should be big enough to hold a single spatial plane from the output
*        cube (all planes will then have the same variance and so only one
*        plane need be calculated). If "is2d" is zero, the "var_array"
*        array should be the same shape and size as the output data array.
*     wgt_array = double * (Given and Returned)
*        An array in which to store the relative weighting for each pixel in
*        the output cube. The supplied array is update on exit to include the
*        data from the supplied input NDF. If "genvar" is 2, this array should
*        be the same size as "var_array". If "genvar" is 1, this array should
*        be twice the size of the "var_array" array.
*     texp_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        A work array, which holds the total exposure time for each output
*        spectrum. It is updated on exit to include the supplied input NDF.
*        It should be big enough to hold a single spatial plane from the
*        output cube.
*     teff_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        A work array, which holds the effective integration time for each
*        output spectrum, scaled by a factor of 4. It is updated on exit to
*        include the supplied input NDF. It should be big enough to hold a
*        single spatial plane from the output cube.
*     fcon = double * (Given and Returned)
*        If "first" is supplied non-zero, then *fcon is returned holding
*        the ratio of the squared backend degradation factor to the spectral
*        channel width (this is the factor needed for calculating the
*        variances from the Tsys value). This returned value should be
*        left unchanged on subsequent invocations of this function. If
*        "first" is zero on entry, the reurned value is VAL__BADD if the
*        factor for the current file has a different value.
*     nused = int64_t * (Given and Returned)
*        Use to accumulate the total number of input data samples that
*        have been pasted into the output cube.
*     nreject = dim_t * (Given and Returned)
*        The number of input spectra that have been ignored becuase they
*        either do not cover the full spectral range of the output or
*        because they have a different bad pixel mask to the output.
*        Only used if "badmask==0" (it is left unchanged otherwise).
*     naccept = dim_t * (Given and Returned)
*        The number of input spectra that have not been ignored. Only used
*        if "badmask==0" (it is left unchanged otherwise).
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the inherited status.

*  Description:
*     The data array of the supplied input NDF is added into the existing
*     contents of the output data array, and the variance and weights
*     arrays are updated correspondingly.
*
*     Note, few checks are performed on the validity of the input data
*     files in this function, since they have already been checked within
*     smf_cubebounds.

*  History:
*     23-APR-2006 (DSB):
*        Initial version.
*     2-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        Add parameter naccept.
*     25-MAY-2007 (TIMJ):
*        Allow fcon to drift a little
*     11-OCT-2007 (DSB):
*        Added parameter "ptime".
*     12-FEB-2008 (DSB):
*        Replaced arguments "index" and "size" with "first" and "last".
*        This is because different output tiles and/or polarisation bins
*        will receive contributions from different input files, not
*        necessarily starting at the first input file or ending at the
*        last.
*     26-SEP-2008 (DSB):
*        Increased tolerance for variations in Tsys conversion factor
*        from 0.001% to 1.0%.
*     14-MAY-2014 (DSB):
*        Report the number of samples pasted into the output cube.

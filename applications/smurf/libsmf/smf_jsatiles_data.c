*  Name:
*     smf_jsatiles_data.

*  Purpose:
*     Find the sky tiles that overlap a given set of JCMT data files.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     int *smf_jsatiles_data( ThrWorkForce *wf, Grp *igrp, dim_t size,
*                             smfJSATiling *tiling, int *ntile, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads
*     igrp = Grp * (Given)
*        A group holding the paths to the data files. This can include
*        non-science files.
*     size = dim_t (Given)
*        The number of data files in "igrp".
*     tiling = smfJSATiling * (Returned)
*        Structure in which to return the parameters of the used tiling
*        scheme.
*     ntile = int * (Returned)
*        The number of tiles in the returned list.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a newly allocated array of ints, each being the
*     identifier of a tile that overlaps the given data. The array
*     should be freed using astFree when no longer needed. NULL is
*     returned without error if non of the input files are science files.

*  Description:
*     This routine returns a list containing the indices of the sky tiles
*     that receive data from a given set of raw data files.

*  Authors:
*     DSB: David Berry (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     12-JUL-2013 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     6-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        In order to take account of changing Epoch, etc., base the
*        hits positions on the AZEL telescope position, not the tracking
*        system position.
*     7-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        Use smf_jsainstrument to select the instrument.
*     9-MAP-2014 (DSB):
*        Speed up by using a recursive algorithm to test only a subset of
*        time slices in each files, and also use a separate thread for
*        opening the files. Also allow non-science files to be supplied.

*     in different tiles.

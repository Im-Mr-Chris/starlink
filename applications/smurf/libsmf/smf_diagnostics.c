*  Name:
*     smf_diagnostics

*  Purpose:
*     Dump diagnostics to disk.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_diagnostics( ThrWorkForce *wf, int where, smfDIMMData *dat,
*		       dim_t chunk, AstKeyMap *keymap, smfArray **allmodel,
*                      smf_modeltype type, int flags, double chunkfactor,
*                      int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads
*     where = int (Given)
*        Indicates where in the algorithm this function is being called,
*        which is used to determine what information to dump to disk.
*        Current options are:
*
*        0: This function is being called immediately before estimating
*        a new model and subtracting it from the residuals.
*
*        1: This function is being called immediately after estimating
*        a new model and subtracting it from the residuals.
*
*     dat = smfDIMMData * (Given)
*        Struct of pointers to information required by model calculation
*     chunk = dim_t (Given)
*        Index of the contiguous chunk of time-series data being processed.
*     keymap = AstKeyMap * (Given)
*        Parameters that control the iterative map-maker. It should
*        contain an entry with key "DIAG" that is a KeyMap with the
*        following entries:
*
*        OUT - The full path/name for the HDS container file in which to
*        store the diagnostic info. This will contain components for each
*        requested model, with names like "COM", "FLT", etc. Each of these
*        components will contain multiple NDFs with names in the following
*        format: "<where>_<chunk>_<what>", where <what> is "power" or "time",
*        <chunk> is the integer chunk index, and <where> is one of:
*           - "bef": the NDF contains the residuals as they were before
*              the model was subtracted.
*           - "mod": the NDF contains the model values themselves.
*           - "aft": the NDF contains the residuals as they were after
*              the model was subtracted.
*        Each NDF will be 2-dimensional, with the first pixel axis
*        representing time or frequency, and the second pixel axis
*        representing iteration number.
*
*        APPEND - If non-zero, it indicates that diagnostic info should be
*        appended to the container file specified by diag.out, which should
*        already exist. If zero, then  any existing container file is first
*        deleted before storing new diagnostics information in it.
*
*        CUBE - If non-zero, a full cube containing time-ordered data for
*        all bolometers is created at each iteration, for each required
*        model and set of residuals. These are placed in 3D NDFs with
*        names in the following format: "<where>_<chunk>_cube_<it>", where
*        <chunk> and <where> are described above (under "OUT") and <it>
*        is the iteration number.
*
*        MAP - If non-zero, a 2D map containing the binned time-stream data
*        for all bolometers is created at each iteration, for each required
*        model and set of residuals. These are placed in 2D NDFs with
*        names in the following format: "<where>_<chunk>_map_<it>", where
*        <chunk> and <where> are described above (under "OUT") and <it>
*        is the iteration number. If the MAP value is positive, the map will
*        contain data for just the subarray specified by "ARRAY".If MAP is
*        negative, the map will contain data for all available subarrays.
*
*        MODELS - Indicates the models that are to be written out. It
*        should be a comma separated list of model names (e.g. COM, FLT,
*        AST, RES, etc) contained within parentheses, or a single model
*        name. A model name of RES here refers to the residuals after
*        subtraction of all models in use (typically COM, FLT and AST).
*        The residuals can also be written out at other times - see
*        RES_BEFORE and RES_AFTER.
*
*        POWER - If non-zero, write out the power spectrum for each
*        selected model.
*
*        TIME - If non-zero, write out the time-series for each selected
*        model.
*
*        MINGOOD - The minimum fraction of good values in a time stream
*        for which data should be dumped. An error is reported if the
*        required minimum value is not met.
*
*        BOLO - Indicates the bolometer for which diagnostic information
*        is required (the sub-array is indicated by ARRAY). It can be:
*
*           - A pair of integers, separated by a comma, contained in
*           parentheses, giving the column and row of the bolometer. The
*           first integer should be in the range 1 to 32, and the second
*           should be in the range 1 to 40.
*
*           - A single integer in the range 1 to 1280.
*
*           - The string "MEAN" (case insensitive), in which case all
*           unflagged data from all good bolometers is averaged to form
*           the time-stream to dump.
*
*           - The string "WMEAN" (case insensitive), in which case all
*           unflagged data from all good bolometers is averaged using
*           weights derived from the bolometer noise estimates to form
*           the time-stream to dump.
*
*           - The string "TYPICAL" (case insensitive), in which case a
*           bolometer with typical noise charactersitics is chosen and
*           used. The index of the chosen bolometer is reported, and
*           stored in the dumped NDFs.
*
*        ARRAY - The name of the array (S8A, S*b, etc) containing the
*        data to be written out. If not supplied, the first available
*        array is used.
*
*        MASK - If non-zero, then the AST model will be masked using the
*        current AST mask before being dumped. Otherwise, the AST model
*        will not be masked before being dumped.
*
*        RES_BEFORE - If non-zero, then in addition to writing out the
*        requested models, the residuals are also written out immediately
*        before each requested model is subtracted.
*
*        RES_AFTER - If non-zero, then in addition to writing out the
*        requested models, the residuals are also written out immediately
*        after each requested model is subtracted.
*
*        LASTONLY - If non-zero, then diagnostics are only created for
*        the last iteration. If zero, then diagnostics are created for
*        all iterations.
*
*     allmodel = smfArray ** (Returned)
*        Array of smfArrays holding the model. Only element zero is used.
*        Should be NULL if the AST model is being dumped.
*     type = smf_modeltype (Given)
*        Indicates which model is to be dumped.
*     flags = int (Given)
*        Control flags.
*     chunkfactor = double (Given)
*        The scale factor for the current chunk.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

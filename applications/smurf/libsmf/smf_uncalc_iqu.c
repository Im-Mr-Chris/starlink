*                          int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads (can be NULL)
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        Pointer to the time series data.
*     idata = double * (Given and Returned)
*        On entry an array of I values. On exit, an array of analysed
*        intensity values. These are assumed to incorporate the POL2
*        degradation factor of 1.35.
*     qdata = double * (Given)
*        An array of Q values. These are assumed to incorporate the POL2
*        degradation factor of 1.35.
*     udata = double * (Given)
*        An array of U values. These are assumed to incorporate the POL2
*        degradation factor of 1.35.
*     angdata = double * (Given)
*        An array holding the angle from the reference direction used by
*        the supplied Q and U values, to the focal plane Y axis, in radians,
*        at each time slice (at each time slice, all bolometers are
*        assumed to have the same reference direction in focal plane
*        coordinates). Positive rotation is in the same sense as rotation
*        from focal plane X to focal plane Y.
*     pasign = int (Given)
*        Should be supplied non-zero if a positive POL_ANG value
*        corresponds to rotation from focal plane X to focal plane Y axis,
*        and zero otherwise.
*     paoff = double (Given)
*        The angle from the fixed analyser to the have-wave plate for a
*        POL_ANG value of zero, in radians. Measured positive in the same
*        sense as rotation from focal plane X to focal plane Y.
*     angrot = double (Given)
*        The angle from the focal plane X axis to the fixed analyser, in
*        radians. Measured positive in the same sense as rotation from focal
*        plane X to focal plane Y.
*     amp2 = double (Given)
*        Ignored if "harmonic" is not 4. It gives the amplitude of the
*        2Hz signal to include in the returned analysed intensity signal, as
*        a fraction of the total intensity. This is an alternative to setting
*        using "harmonic" to 1.
*     amp4 = double (Given)
*        Ignored if "harmonic" is not 4. It gives the amplitude of the
*        4Hz signal to include in the returned analysed intensity signal, as
*        a fraction of the total intensity. This is an alternative to setting
*        using "harmonic" to 2.
*     amp16 = double (Given)
*        Ignored if "harmonic" is not 4. It gives the amplitude of the
*        16Hz signal to include in the returned analysed intensity signal, as
*        a fraction of the total intensity. This is an alternative to setting
*        using "harmonic" to 8.
*     phase2 = double (Given)
*        Ignored if "harmonic" is not 4. It gives the phase offset for the
*        2Hz signal to include in the returned Q and U signal, in radians.
*     phase4 = double (Given)
*        Ignored if "harmonic" is not 4. It gives the phase offset for the
*        4Hz signal to include in the returned Q and U signal, in radians.
*     phase16 = double (Given)
*        Ignored if "harmonic" is not 4. It gives the phase offset for the
*        16Hz signal to include in the returned Q and U signal, in radians.
*     ipform = int (Given):
*        Indicates the IP model to use: 0="NONE, 1 ="PL1", 2="JK", 3="USER",
*        4="PL2", 5 = "PL3".
*     pldata = const double * (Given):
*        The parameters of the PL1, PL2 or PL3 IP model. Only used if
*        "ipform" is 1, 4 or 5. The length of this array should be 3 for PL1
*        and 4 for PL2/PL3.
*     qinst = const double * (Given)
*        Only used if "ipform" is 3. An array of normalised Q values
*        for each bolometer. The instrumental Q seen by each bolometer is
*        found by multiplying the corresponding total intensity by this
*        factor. The fixed analyser is assumed to be the reference direction.
*     uinst = const double * (Given)
*        Only used if "ipform" is 3. An array of normalised U values
*        for each bolometer. The instrumental U seen by each bolometer is
*        found by multiplying the corresponding total intensity by this
*        factor. The fixed analyser is assumed to be the reference direction.
*     c0 = const double * (Given)
*        Only used if "ipform" is 2. An array of C0 values for each
*        bolometer. C0 is one of terms in the POL2 instrumental polarisation
*        model created by Doug Johnstone and James Kennedy.
*     p0 = const double * (Given)
*        Only used if "ipform" is 2. An array of P0 values for each
*        bolometer. P0 is one of terms in the POL2 instrumental polarisation
*        model created by Doug Johnstone and James Kennedy.
*     p1 = const double * (Given)
*        Only used if "ipform" is 2. An array of P1 values for each
*        bolometer. P1 is one of terms in the POL2 instrumental polarisation
*        model created by Doug Johnstone and James Kennedy.
*     angc = const double * (Given)
*        Only used if "ipform" is 2. An array of ANGC values for each
*        bolometer. ANGC is one of terms in the POL2 instrumental polarisation
*        model created by Doug Johnstone and James Kennedy.
*     harmonic = int  (Given)
*        The harmonic of the half-wave plate rotation from which the Q
*        and U values should be derived. This should normally be 4, but
*        other values can be used to investigate the effects of asymetry in
*        the half-wave plate, etc.
*     offset = double (Given)
*        The constant total intensity (in pW) caused by electronic
*        offset rather than sky emission. This value is assumed to be the
*        same for all bolometers and time-slices. It is subtracted off
*        the supplied total intensity before calculating the returned
*        analysed intensity values.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This function converts the supplied arrays holding (I,Q,U) values
*     into analysed intensity, and returns them in place of the I values.

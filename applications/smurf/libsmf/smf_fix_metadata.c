*  Name:
*     smf_fix_metadata

*  Purpose:
*     Fix observation metadata

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     int smf_fix_metadata( msglev_t msglev, smfData * data, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     msglev = msglev_t (Given)
*        Messaging level to be used for output information. This allows a
*        task whose entire job is to fix up meta data to report information
*        at default level whereas a task that simply wants the data fixed before
*        proceeding could use a debug level.
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        smfData to be examined and fixed.
*     status = int * (Given & Returned)
*        Pointer to global status

*  Returned Value:
*     Returns int indicating whether the meta data were modified. 0 indicates
*     no modifications were made. Bits corresponding to the smf_metadata_fixups
*     enum will be used to indicate which parts of the meta data were modified.

*  Description:
*     Analyzes the smfData struct and determines whether meta data
*     should be modified. If necessary the FitsChan and JCMTSTATE components
*     will be updated. In some cases it is necessary to open the data file to
*     read information from the XML configuration content. If that XML is unavailable
*     some modifications will not be possible.
*
*     The disk file associated with the smfData will not be updated. The data
*     component is not required to be mapped.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     EC: Ed Chapin (UBC)
*     BRADC: Brad Cavanagh (JAC, Hawaii)

*  Notes:
*     o Works on ACSIS and SCUBA-2 data.  All other smfDatas cause the
*     function to return without comment.
*     o OFF exposure calculation for scan observations is an estimate
*     due to the difficulty of working out exactly where in the scan a
*     particular spectrum is from. Accurate determination requires all files
*     from a single observation.
*     o OFF exposure calculation for continuum jiggle observations will
*     be incorrect.

*  History:
*     2009-05-19 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version. Just processes ACS_EXPOSURE and ACS_OFFEXPOSURE
*     2009-05-25 (TIMJ):
*        Use new smf_obsmap_report API.
*     2009-06-01 (EC):
*        Need to include strings.h for strncasecmp
*     2009-06-22 (TIMJ):
*        Check OCS Config before flipping sign of instrument aperture
*     2009-07-06 (TIMJ):
*        Add ability to look up information in table indexed by OBSID.
*     2009-10-28 (BRADC):
*        Check for missing FFT_WIN header.
*     2009-11-27 (TIMJ):
*        Call SCUBA-2 and ACSIS specialist fixup routines.
*     2014-03-28 (TIMJ):
*        Only run ACSIS and SCUBA-2 fixups with those specific instruments.
*     2014-04-11 (TIMJ):
*        Do not run STEPTIME guessing code unless we really are ACSIS or SCUBA-2.
*     2018-10-02 (DSB):
*        STEPTIME guess now ignores initial padding that has constant rts
*        values.
*     2019-03-19 (GSB):
*        Avoid reading beyond end of state array.  Correct sense of rts_end
*        comparison.
*     2020-2-24 (GSB):
*        Ensure the header structure always contains a steptime estimate
*        before calling smf_fix_metadata_scuba2.

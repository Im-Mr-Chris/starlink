*  Name:
*     smf_find_gains

*  Purpose:
*     Using a given template, find the gain and offset for each bolometer
*     in a smfData and reject aberrant bolometers.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     int smf_find_gains( ThrWorkForce *wf, int flags, smfData *data,
*                         const unsigned char *mask, smfData *lut,
*                         double *template, AstKeyMap *keymap,
*                         smf_qual_t goodqual, smf_qual_t badqual,
*                         smfData *gain, int *nrej, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads (can be NULL)
*     flags = int (Given)
*        - The first bit indicates if time slices within unusual
*        bolometer-block should be flagged with "badqual". If the first
*        bit is unset, then time slices within bad bolo-blocks are flagged.
*        - The second bit indicates whether to report information about
*        the number of converged blocks. If unset, messages indicating
*        how many blocks have converged are reported. If set, these
*        messages are not reported.
*        - The third bit indicates whether to check bolo-blocks that have
*        already converged. If set then all bolo-blocks are checked to
*        see if they have unusual gains or correlation coefficients. If
*        unset, only bolo-blocks which have not converged are checked.
*        messages are not reported.
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        The input data. Each bolometer time series will be compared to
*        the template. Samples rejected as aberrant will be flagged using
*        "badqual".
*     mask = const unsigned char * (Given)
*        Pointer to a 2D mask of boolean values. May be NULL. If supplied,
*        the mask should have the bounds of the output map. And time
*        samples in "data" that correspond to zero-valued pixels in this
*        mask are excluded from the fitting process.
*     lut = smfData * (Given)
*        The index of the corresponding pixel within "mask" for each sample
*        in "data". Only used if "mask" is not NULL.
*     template = double * (Given)
*        The 1-dimensional template. The length of this array should
*        equal the number of time slices in "data".
*     keymap = AstKeyMap * (Given)
*        An AST KeyMap holding values for the parameters required by this
*        function:
*
*        - corr_abstol (double): A bolometer is rejected if its correlation
*        coefficient is lower corr_abstol.
*
*        - corr_tol (double): A bolometer is rejected if its correlation
*        coefficient is lower than the mean correlation coefficient by more
*        than corr_tol times the standard deviation of the correlation
*        coefficients. Note, all correlation coefficients lower than
*        "corr_abstol" are removed before finding the mean and standard
*        deviation of the correlation coefficients.
*
*        - fit_box (int): The number of adjacent time slices (or seconds
*        if negative) that are to be used when fitting the data to the
*        template. fit_box should be no smaller than gain_box.
*
*        - gain_abstol (double): A bolometer is rejected if its log(gain)
*        value more than gain_abstol from the mean log(gain) value. Note, all
*        negative gains are removed before finding the mean of the log(gain)
*        values.
*
*        - gain_box (int): The number of adjacent time slices that are
*        to be described using a single gain and offset.
*
*        - gain_fgood (double): The minimum number of good blocks required
*        for a usable bolometer, expressed as fraction in the range zero
*        to one.
*
*        - gain_is_one (int): If non-zero, the bolometer gains determined
*        by the least squares linear fit are ignored, and a value of unity
*        is used for all gains. The offsets and correlation coefficients
*        are still determined.
*
*        - gain_positive (int): If non-zero gains must be positive. If zero,
*        negative gains will be allowed.
*
*        - gain_rat (double): The square root of the ratio of the maximum
*        acceptable block gain within a bolometer to the minimum acceptable
*        block gain. It is used when checking for consistency amongst the
*        blocks of a single bolometer.
*
*        - gain_tol (double): A bolometer is rejected if its log(gain)
*        value more than gain_tol standard deviations from the mean
*        log(gain) value. Note, all negative gains are removed before
*        finding the mean and standard deviation of the log(gain) values.
*
*        - noflag (int): If non-zero, then no bolometer blocks are
*        rejected or flagged by this function.
*
*        - offset_is_zero (int): If non-zero, the bolometer offsets are
*        forced to zero within the least squares linear fit. The gains and
*        correlation coefficients are still determined.
*
*     goodqual = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        The quality value to be used when checking for values to be
*        included in the comparison.
*     badqual = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        The quality value to be assigned to samples that are found to be
*        aberrant. In addition, if an entire bolometer is set bad, its
*        first sample will be flagged with SMF__Q_BADB.
*     gain = smfData * (Given & Returned)
*        This holds the gains, offsets and correlation coefficients that
*        scale the template values into the bolometer values for each block:
*
*        data ~= scale*template + offset
*
*        In this smfData, the time axis is subverted to enumerate the
*        coefficients, and should have a length of 3*gain_box. For each
*        bolometer, the first "gain_box" values on the time axis contain
*        the gain values for the bolometer, the next block of "gain_box"
*        values are the offsets for the bolometer, and the final block of
*        "gain_box" values are the correlation coefficients.
*
*        The array should be filled with zeros before calling this function
*        for the first time. New gains, offsets, and correlation coefficients
*        for each bolometer in each block are found and returned in this
*        smfData. The exception tp this is that the values for any block that
*        has already converged (i.e. any block from which no bolometers were
*        rejected on the previous invocation of this function -see argument
*        "nrej") are left unchanged. Also, any values that are VAL__BADD
*        on entry (i.e. previously rejected bolometer blocks) are left
*        unchanged
*
*        On exit, a gain of VAL__BADD is assigned to any blocks that could
*        not be fit to the template, or that were rejected.
*     nrej = int * (Given and Returned)
*        NULL, or a pointer to an array with one element for each bolometer
*        block. That is, the size of this array should equal the number of
*        blocks per bolometer, (i.e. one third of the size of the "time"
*        axis in "gai"). The array should be filled with arbitrary non
*        zero values before calling this function for the first time. On
*        exit, each element holds the number of bolometers rejected from
*        the corresponding block during the current invocation of this
*        function (i.e. bolometers rejected on previous invocations are
*        not included in the returned counts). Thus if a value of zero is
*        returned for a particular block, then it means that no further
*        bolometers have been rejected from that block. The supplied
*        values are used to determine whether it is necessary to
*        re-calculate the gains and offsets for the bolometers in each
*        block - if a block has a supplied value of zero in this array,
*        and the two neighbouring blocks are also supplied as zero, then
*        the central block of these three has converged, and so the
*        bolometer gains and offsets in the central block (supplied
*        within "gai") are left unchanged on exit. Note, the supplied
*        values are treated as boolean zero/non-zero values - the specific
*        non-zero value supplied is insignificant.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned value:
*     The total number of bolometer blocks rejected by the current
*     invocation of this function (i.e. the sum of the values returned in
*     the "nrej" array).

*  Description:
*     Each bolometer time series in the supplied smfData is split into
*     blocks, and each block that corresponds to a non-zero value in "nrej"
*     (or a non-zero neighbouring value in "nrej") is compared against the
*     corresponding samples in the supplied template (after any masking
*     specified by "mask" and "lut"). The number of blocks into which each
*     bolometer time series is to be split is given by config parameter
*     GAIN_BOX (read from the supplied KeyMap)
*
*     Each such comparison performs a least square linear fit relating the
*     template values to the bolometer values, and gain, offset and
*     correlation coefficient are returned in the "gai" smfData. Any blocks
*     that have unusal gains, or that are a poor fit to the template, are
*     flagged by setting the quality bits indicated by "badqual" in the
*     returned quality array. In addition, such bad bolometer blocks are
*     assigned a gain value of VAL__BADD in "gai" upon exit.

*  History:
*     13-JUN-2010 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     27-APR-2011 (EC):
*        Add gain_positive flag
*     08-AUG-2011 (EC):
*        Add noflag keymap option to skip bad bolo flagging
*     27-FEB-2012 (DSB):
*        Add args "mask" and "lut".
*     6-MAY-2012 (DSB):
*        Add argument "flags". Also changed so that bad blocks are
*        indicated by the correlation coefficient being set to
*        VAL__BADD (previously, the gain value was set to VAL__BADD)
*        but the gains in bad blocks are useful within the context of
*        the new COM algorithm.
*     1-JUN-2012 (DSB):
*        Replace gains and offsets for bad blocks with values
*        interpolated from the neighbouring good blocks.
*     1-MAY-2015 (DSB):
*        Correct usage of FIT_BOX value (previously ignored if negative).
*     4-JUN-2015 (DSB):
*        Allow a NULL value to be supplied for "nrej" (in which case it
*        is assumed that no blocks have converged).
*     12-JUN-2015 (DSB):
*        If NOFLAG is set, we still need to ensure that there are no BAD
*        or NOFIT values in the returned GAI data, so that smf_gandoff can
*        interpolate them.
*     24-FEB-2017 (DSB):
*        If bit 0 of the supplied flags is set (i.e. do not flag bad
*        bolo-blocks), then ensure bad bolo blocks are not flagged (i.e.
*        make sure the behaviour is the same as if the NOFLAG config
*        parameter is set).

*  Name:
*     smf1_find_gains_job

*  Purpose:
*     Find the gain and offset for each bolo block.

*  Invocation:
*     void smf1_find_gains_job( void *job_data, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     job_data = void * (Given)
*        Pointer to the data needed by the job. Should be a pointer to a
*        smfFindGainsJobData structure.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine performs a least squares linear fit between the
*     data values in each bolo block, and the supplied template. It
*     runs within a thread instigated by smf_find_gains.

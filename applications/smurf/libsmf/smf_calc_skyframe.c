*  Name:
*     smf_calc_skyframe

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate the output skyframe

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_calc_skyframe( AstFrame *skyin, const char * system,
*                             const smfHead* hdr, int alignsys,
*                             AstSkyFrame ** skyframe, double skyref[2],
*                             int * moving, int * status )

*  Arguments:
*     skyin = AstFrame * (Given)
*        Input sky frame to use as reference.
*     system = char* (Given)
*        Specifies the celestial coordinate system which will be used to
*        describe the spatial axes of the output cube. It should be a
*        valid value for the System attribute of an AST SkyFrame, or
*        "TRACKING".
*     hdr = const smfHead* (Given)
*        Header to be used to calculate base position and tracking system.
*     alignsys = int (Given)
*        If non-zero, then the input data will be aligned in the coordinate
*        system specified by "system" rather than in the default system
*        (ICRS).
*     skyframe = AstFrameSet ** (Returned)
*        A pointer to a location at which to return a pointer to an AST
*        SkyFrame describing the spatial axes of the output WCS FrameSet.
*        If "moving" is non-zero, the spatial axes represent (lon,lat)
*        offsets (in the requested "system") from the base telescope position
*        associated with the first time slice.
*     skyref = double[2] (Returned)
*        Reference position to be used for this sky frame.
*     moving = int* (Returned)
*        Address of an int in which to return a flag indicating if the
*        telescope is tracking a moving object. If so, the returned
*        SkyFrame will describe offsets (in the system specified by "system")
*        from the base pointing position for the first time slice.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     2006-11-14 (DSB):
*        Original smf_cubegrid implementation.
*     2008-06-04 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version factored out of smf_cubegrid
*     2009-08-25 (DSB):
*        Added args "igrp" and "size" to allow returned "*moving" value to
*        be based on the total distance moved by the tracking centre over
*        all supplied observations rather than just one observation.
*     2009-09-09 (EC):
*        Add extra status checks
*     2009-09-11 (DSB):
*        Cater for SCUBA-2 file names in addition to ACSIS.
*     2009-09-14 (DSB):
*        Removed "igrp" and "size". Returned "moving" value is now determined
*        just from the supplied output coordinate system.

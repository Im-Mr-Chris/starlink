*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads that will do the re-binning.
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        Pointer to the input smfData structure.

*        cube?
*     ptime = dim_t * (Given)
*        Pointer to an array of integers, each one being the index of a
*        time slice that is to be pasted into the output cube. If this is
*        NULL, then all time slices are used. The values in the array
*        should be monotonic increasing and should be terminated by a value
*        of VAL__MAXK.
*     nchan = dim_t (Given)
*        Number of spectral channels in input cube.
*     ndet = dim_t (Given)

*     abskyfrm = AstSkyFrame * (Given)
*        A SkyFrame that specifies the coordinate system used to describe
*        the spatial axes of the output cube. This should represent

*        non-zero.
*     oskymap = AstFrameSet * (Given)
*        A Mapping from 2D sky coordinates in the output cube to 2D
*        spatial pixel coordinates in the output cube.
*     detgrp = Grp ** (Given)
*        On entry, a Group containing the names of the detectors to be
*        used. All detectors will be used if this group is empty (or NULL).
*        On exit, the supplied group (if any) is deleted, and a new group
*        is created and return holding the names of the detectors that
*        contributed any good data to the output cube.
*     moving = int (Given)
*        A flag indicating if the telescope is tracking a moving object. If

*        output cube.

*        A flag indicating if the input data should be weighted according
*        to the input variances determined from the input Tsys values.
*     spread = int (Given)
*        Specifies the scheme to be used for dividing each input data value
*        up amongst the corresponding output pixels. See docs for astRebinSeq
*        (SUN/211) for the allowed values.
*     params = const double[] (Given)
*        An optional pointer to an array of double which should contain any
*        additional parameter values required by the pixel spreading scheme.
*        See docs for astRebinSeq (SUN/211) for further information. If no
*        additional parameters are required, this array is not used and a
*        NULL pointer may be given.
*     genvar = int (Given)
*        Indicates how the output variances should be calculated:
*           0 = do not calculate any output variances
*           1 = use spread of input data values
*           2 = use system noise temperatures
*     tfac = double (Given)
*        Factor describing spectral overlap. Used to reduce the weight of
*        spectra that do not have much spectral overlap with the output.
*     fcon = double (Given)
*        The ratio of the squared backend degradation factor to the spectral
*        channel width (this is the factor needed for calculating the
*        variances from the Tsys value).
*     data_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        The data array for the output cube. This is updated on exit to
*        include the data from the supplied input NDF.
*     var_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        An array in which to store the variances for the output cube if
*        "genvar" is not zero (the supplied pointer is ignored if "genvar" is
*        zero). The supplied array is update on exit to include the data from
*        the supplied input NDF. This array should be the same shape and size
*        as the output data array.
*     wgt_array = double * (Given and Returned)
*        An array in which to store the relative weighting for each pixel in
*        the output cube. The supplied array is update on exit to include the
*        data from the supplied input NDF. This array should be the length of
*        "data_array", unless "genvar" is 1, in which case it should be twice
*        the length of "data_array".
*     texp_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        A work array, which holds the total exposure time for each output
*        spectrum. It is updated on exit to include the supplied input NDF.
*        It should be big enough to hold a single spatial plane from the
*        output cube.
*     teff_array = float * (Given and Returned)
*        A work array, which holds the effective integration time for each
*        output spectrum, scaled by a factor of 4. It is updated on exit to
*        include the supplied input NDF. It should be big enough to hold a
*        single spatial plane from the output cube.
*     good_tsys = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Returned set to 1 if any good Tsys values were found in the
*        input cube.
*     nused = int64_t * (Given and Returned)
*        Use to accumulate the total number of input data samples that
*        have been pasted into the output cube.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the inherited status.

*  Description:
*     The data array of the supplied input NDF is added into the existing
*     contents of the output data array, and the variance and weights
*     arrays are updated correspondingly.
*
*     Since astRebinSeq is used, various spreading schemes are available
*     when pasting each input pixel value into the output cube. The
*     arrays that are used to record the output weights and variances are
*     3-dimensional, meaning that each output pixel has its own weight and
*     variance.  A pixel is bad in the output only if the total weight of
*     the good input pixels that contribute to it is more than 0.
*
*     Note, few checks are performed on the validity of the input data
*     files in this function, since they have already been checked within
*     smf_cubebounds.

*  History:
*     18-APR-2006 (DSB):
*        Initial version.
*     18-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Corrections to handle cases where there is only 1 detector.
*     12-JUL-2007 (EC):
*        -Changed name of smf_rebincube_totmap to smf_rebin_totmap
*     2-OCT-2007 (DSB):
*        Use nearest neighbour interpolation with the "detlut" LutMap.
*     11-OCT-2007 (DSB):
*        Added parameter "ptime".
*     8-MAY-2008 (DSB):
*        Use AST__USEVAR flag with astRebinSeq if output variances are
*        based on input noise temperatures.
*     11-FEB-2009 (DSB):
*        Ignore negative or zero input Tsys values.
*     1-OCT-2012 (DSB):
*        Retain all flags when calling astRebinSeq for the last time to
*        normalise the returned values. Previously, lack of the AST__USEVAR
*        flag was causing all output varianes to be set bad within astRebinseq.
*     14-MAY-2014 (DSB):
*        Do not attempt to normalise empty cubes, but issue a warning
*        instead.
*     29-OCT-2020 (DSB):
*        "detgrp" is now used to return the names of the detectors that
*        contributed good data to the cube.

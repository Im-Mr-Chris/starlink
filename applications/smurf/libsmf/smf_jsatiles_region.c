*  Name:
*     smf_jsatiles_region.

*  Purpose:
*     Find the sky tiles that overlap a given AST Region.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     int *smf_jsatiles_region( AstRegion *region, smfJSATiling *skytiling,
*                               int *ntile, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     region = AstRegion * (Given)
*        The Region.
*     skytiling = smfJSATiling * (Given)
*        Structure holding the parameters that define the layout of JSA
*        tiles for the selected instrument.
*     ntile = int * (Returned)
*        The number of tiles in the returned list.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a newly allocated array of ints, each being the
*     identifier of a tile that overlaps the given Region. The array
*     should be freed using astFree when no longer needed.

*  Description:
*     This routine returns a list containing the indices of the sky tiles
*     (for a named JCMT instrument) that receive data from a given AST
*     Region.

*  Authors:
*     DSB: David Berry (JAC, Hawaii)

*  History:
*     12-JUL-2013 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     7-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        Changed old "instrument" parameter to "skytiling".
*     18-SEP-2014 (DSB):
*        The mapping from sky to tile (x,y) offsets is very non-linear
*        for regions that straddle the RA=12h meridian. So ensure that
*        this is taken into account when simplifying the Region if it is
*        a Polygon.

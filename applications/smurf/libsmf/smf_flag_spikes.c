*  Name:
*     smf_flag_spikes

*  Purpose:
*     Flag n-sigma excursions (spikes) from the rolling median of a data stream

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_flag_spikes( ThrWorkForce *wf, smfData *data, smf_qual_t mask,
*                       double thresh, dim_t box, dim_t *nflagged,
*                       int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads
*     data = smfData * (Given and Returned)
*        The data that will be flagged. Locations of spikes
*        will have bit SMF__Q_SPIKE set on exit.
*     mask = smf_qual_t (Given)
*        Define which bits in quality are relevant to ignore data in
*        the calculation.
*     thresh = double (Given)
*        Number of standard deviations at which to clip spikes.
*     box = dim_t (Given)
*        The number of time slices to include in the median filter box.
*     nflagged = dim_t * (Returned)
*        The number of new samples that were flagged. May be NULL.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Each bolometer is processed independently. At each time slice, the
*     median value of the current bolometer in a 1D box centred on the time
*     slice, and containing "box" time slices, is found. If the residual
*     between the time slice value and the median value is greater than
*     "thresh" times the local noise level, the time slice is flagged as
*     a spike within the quality mask.
*
*     The local noise level is the standard deviation of the time slice
*     values in a 1D box containing "box" time slices, and which is
*     adjacent to the filter box used for determing the median value. That
*     is, the high end of the noise box is just below the low end of the
*     median filter box. This introduces a slight asymentry in the noise,
*     but this should not matter unless the noise varies significantly on
*     a time scale shorter than the box size. The advantage of using an
*     offset noise box is that time slices found to contain a spike can be
*     omitted from the noise box, thus preventing the spike from upsetting
*     the local noise estimate.
*
*     Some complication is introduced into the coding is an attempt to
*     speed up the median filtering.

*  Notes:
*     - No spikes are ever flagged in the first and last "box/2" time-slices.

*  History:
*     2010-01-10 (DSB):
*        Initial Version
*     2010-09-14 (EC):
*        Parallelize over blocks of bolometers
*     2015-06-11 (DSB):
*        Five years later, we discover that time-based de-spiking has
*        been completely broken the whole time because of incorrect
*        indexing within the parallel code.

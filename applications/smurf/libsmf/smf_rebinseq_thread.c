*  Name:
*     smf_rebinseq_thread

*  Purpose:
*     Invoke astRebinSeqF/D from within a thread.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     void smf_rebinseq_thread( void *data, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     data = void * (Given)
*        A pointer to a data structure (a smfRebinSeqArgs) holding parameter
*        values for astRebinSeq.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        A pointer to the inherited status value.

*  Description:
*     This function invokes astRebinSeqF or astRebinSeqF from within a
*     new thread. The API for this function is dictated by the
*     thrAddJob function, so information needed for astRebinSeq
*     is passed into this function within a smfRebinSeqArgs structure.

*     David S Berry (JAC, UClan)

*  Name:
*     smf_select_cqualpntr

*  Purpose:
*     Select the relevant pointer to quality information from a const smfData

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     const smf_qual_t * smf_select_cqualpntr( const smfData *data,
*                                smf_qfam_t * qfamily, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     data = const smfData * data (Given)
*        Input smfData.
*     qfamily = smf_qfam_t * qfamily (Returned)
*        If non-NULL will return the quality family associated with
*        the selected quality pointer.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Decides which pointer in the smfData should be used for quality
*     handling. The quality will be selected in the following order:
*
*     - If the "qual" pointer is defined return it
*     - If the "sidequal" smfData is non-null and has a "qual" pointer
*       return that.
*     - If the "sidequal" smfData is non-null and pntr[0] is defined
*       with data type SMF__QUALTYPE that is the quality.
*     - If all that has failed look at the primary pntr[0] to decide
*       if it looks like a quality array after all.
*
*     Else a NULL pointer is returned.

*  Returned Value:
*     const smf_qual_t *
*        Relevant pointer to quality or NULL if none could be found.

*  Notes:
*     See also smf_select_qualpntr
